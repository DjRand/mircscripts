## mIRC Scripts.
mIRC Scripts - Various scripts by yours truly.  


## NIBL - Bot Search.  
This script is designed to make finding files on the #nibl mIRC channel much easier.
Instead of typing "!s stuff" to find stuff in the channel, you can use /nibl stuff.
Or if you want to request from a specific bot /nibl -b botname, or /nibl -b botname stuff.
Results show up in a seperate window, with clickable tags that will request the file.
Includes an auto-retry for incomplete file transfers, for files initiated through the @nibl window.
